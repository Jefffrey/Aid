#Aid

###Synopsis

This repositories contains data structures and algorithms that I've wrote once and never ever want to write again.
It can be seen as a simple C++ toolbox like any other.

###Dependencies

The library depends on:

 - C++14
 - Boost.Any

###Installation

This is an header-only library, so the installation is as simple as pasting the content of the `include/` folder into some accessible path.

###Testing

To run tests, execute the following commands from the root of this folder:

```
./bootstrap.py
ninja
./tests
```
